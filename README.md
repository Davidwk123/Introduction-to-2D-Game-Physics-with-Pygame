# Introduction-to-2D-Game-Physics-with-Pygame
Archived college course on 2D game physics using Pygame.

I have been following an archived college course created by James D. Miller (jim.miller.tc@gmail.com). It is an introductory course on 2D game physics using the PyGame Python library. I have been working through the examples and assignments one by one to build a solid understanding of these concepts. My goal is to eventually create my own game using these newly acquired skills.
